#Beginning print statement for program, input variable, and additional variables are set.
#Using '.lower()' makes all letters in the string lower case. Easy to compare and simplifies the program.
print("\n\nYou color choices are red, blue, green, white or yellow.\n")
userColor= input('Enter a color from the list above: ') 
userColor = userColor.lower()
validColor = True
spanishColor = ''

#First If/Else statement which compares the input (userColor) and places new data into the spanishColor variable.
if userColor == 'red':
	spanishColor = 'rojo'
elif userColor == 'blue':
	spanishColor = 'azul'
elif userColor == 'green':
	spanishColor = 'verde'
elif userColor == 'white':
	spanishColor = 'blanco'
elif userColor == 'yellow':
	spanishColor = 'amarillo'
else:
	validColor = False

#Second If/Else statement which prints the results of the program.
if validColor == True:
	print('The color ' + userColor + ' in Spanish is ' + spanishColor + '.\n')
else:
	print('That is not a valid color for this program. Ese no es un color v√°lido.\n')

#Another route to go with this program is to place the print statements into the First If/Else Statement but it becomes more complicated going that route.
